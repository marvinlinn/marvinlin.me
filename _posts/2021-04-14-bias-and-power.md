*Please note that these are my opinions, thoughts, and perspectives at one point of time. These thoughts may be wrong or change over time. The intent of these thoughts is to drive discussion, not hate.*

### Everyone is capable of holding and acting on racial bias. What happens when people in positions of power with the ability to harm decide to act on their racial bias?

Bias, racial or non racial, will always exist in us. Often times, we will act on them because it's the path of least resistance. However, this doesn't mean you cannot a) acknowledge your bias and b) separate yourself from bias through education to the best of your ability. This is true regardless of who you are and what power you have. In the case of those with high power by any means (a CEO, police officer, etc.), there lies a greater responsibility to actively acknowledge bias and seek to remove oneself from this bias. By acting on ones bias, it can and will violate the trust given to them by those (often times the general public) who bestow the power upon them. Consequences, as we've seen, often times is the removal of this power.

### What does justice look like?

### What does it mean to be held accountable?

### How do we extend care to each other in times of trauma and crisis?

In regards to both questions, I want to emphasize the importance of genuine care in the actions that are taken to hold people accountable and extending care to others. Sadly, more often than not, organizations and people will appear to hold those accountable and/or appear to extend care, for the sake of PR, for the sake of making themselves "look good" in these times of trauma and crisis. I don't want to assume and say who and/or what actions others have taken and label them as "PR" or purely for their own public image, but the reality is when many of these events pass over, nothing is beyond, constant support – “fake friends” and support.
