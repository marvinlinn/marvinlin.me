Find all of my essays here! I write about all thing and anything! This includes my thoughts about current world events, philosophy, my life expereinces, and more. Some may be more journalistic in nature, while others will be a simple commentary. 

Keep in mind, all of these essays are my thoughts, opinions, and perspective at **ONE** point of time. These thoughts may be wrong or change over time. The intent of these essays is to have discussion, never hate.

I *usually* write every month, however depending on my schedule, it may vary. Check them out below!
