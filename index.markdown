My name is Marvin, and welcome to my digital home! I'm a engineering, athlete, and writer. You can find
more about some of the projects I am currently working on and/or have worked on over the years. Below, you can also find some of my most recent essays. 

The essays that I write range in topics. Most, if not all, are inspired by personal expereinces and current events. Although there
is no regular posting schedule, I aim to write at least once a month. I hope you all enjoy reading!
