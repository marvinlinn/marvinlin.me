I"æ<p>Hello Friends! My name is Marvin, a student in Portland, OR.</p>

<p>Over the years, I have started writing essays (or as others like to call it, blog posts) to express my personal thoughts. Iâ€™ve always been restricted by the location where I post my work. Either it was too expensive (essentially not free), didnâ€™t fit my visual standards, or required too much friction to post. This site you see now is the best solution I could find.</p>

<p>This new website provides the foundation I need to begin writing and posting on a more regualar basis. Once Iâ€™ve got more time, I will  fully develop this website (which means learning how to build a Jekyll Theme and some Ruby) to better represent myself. For now, this will suffice.</p>
